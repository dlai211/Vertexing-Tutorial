# Week 8

## Tasks for the Week:

 - [ ] finish producing an accurate plot for **truth match fraction**.
 - [ ] learn about reconstruction efficiency & selection efficiency & ROOT.
 - [ ] produce TEfficiency plots for reco & selection efficiency.

## Tutorials:

 - we have set up [ROOT](https://root.cern.ch/root/htmldoc/guides/primer/ROOTPrimer.pdf) (recommended to go through the tutorial step by step) for jupyter lab by entering `source root/bin/thisroot.sh` before starting the Jupyter Lab.
 - we will use [TEfficiency](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTEfficiency.html) function for the graphing. Please finish the **third** example "Filling with Events". 
 - The code is written in C++, to translate into python:
 ``` python
import ROOT 

# Set up a new canvas
c1 = ROOT.TCanvas("example","",600,400)
c1.SetFillStyle(1001)
c1.SetFillColor(kWhite)


# create one-dimensional TEfficiency object with fixed bin size 
pEff = ROOT.TEfficiency("eff","my efficiency;x;#epsilon",20,0,10)
rand3 = ROOT.TRandom3()

for i in range(10000):
    #simulate events with variable under investigation
    x = rand3.Uniform(10)
    # check selection: bPassed = DoesEventPassSelection(x)
    bPassed = rand3.Rndm() < ROOT.TMath.Gaus(x,5,4)
    pEff.Fill(bPassed,x)
    
pEff.Draw()
c1.Draw()
```

## Reconstruction Efficiency

 - To successfully reconstruct a Hard Scatter vertex, one test is done: `|reco(max(number of associated tracks)) - truth_HS| < 0.1 mm`
   - or in words, reconstruction condition: the distance between the reconstructed vertex with the maximum number of associated tracks (same as hard scatter truth vertex) and the hard scatter truth vertex is less than 0.1 mm. 
 - Similar to the code above, `pEff.Fill(bPassed,x)`, the code will be `TEff.Fill([reconstruction condition], localPUDensity)`
 
#### LocalPUDensity (around Truth HS vertices)

 - local pile-up density near a vertex, defined as the number of generated vertices per unit length within a symmetrical Â±2 mm longitudinal window
 - You loop around the vertices and find each difference between Truth vertices and Truth HS vertices, and for those are less than 2, count the total in one event and divide by `2 * LocalPUDensity`, hence the local PU Density.
 
## Selection Efficiency
 - To successfully select a Hard Scatter vertex, one test is done: `Reconstructed Vertex with max(PT^2) = [max(number of associated tracks) - HS <= 0.1]` (should be self-explanatory) 
   - Side notes: ATLAS definition - the reconstructed vertex with highest pT2 is the one containing the largest total weight from true HS tracks.
   - BUT we don't have a truth track weight output, so we have to base on Athena definition for this one.
  
 - And of course, `TEff.Fill([selection condition], localPUDensity)`
